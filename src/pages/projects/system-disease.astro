    For our first simulation, we added a death rate on top of the infection rate
    so once someone gets infected they will die after some time. For our second
    simulation, we made it so our simulation modeled rabies and in this, we
    added an incubation period, lower infection rate, and higher death rate.
    Since rabies can only be passed through animals we added dogs as well who
    matched up with the humans.
